# LAB 41 - Phone-App

Author: Adrienne Frey

## Problem Domain/Features:

   Phase 1:
    Create your first native phone/device application using React Native, tapping into at least 2 phone features.

    Use at least 1 native device feature (Contacts, Camera, GPS, etc)

    Milestone 1 - MVP (This Lab)
    Deliver your MVP for raw functionality
    Your dev environment should be properly working
    Other users should be able to scan your QR and see your app on any device
    All of your core “features” should be working properly
    Un-Styled is fine. We’re looking for things to buzz, light up, detect movement, etc.
